    "A set in Python is a collection of unique elements that are unordered. This means that you cannot access elements by indices, and the elements are stored in an unordered manner. The main feature of a set is that each element in the set must be unique. Sets are useful when you want to perform set operations, such as mathematical set operations (e.g., union, difference, intersection).\n",

    "A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. Dictionaries are unique in the sense that they allow us to associate specific values with specific keys, making it easy to retrieve values by referring to their corresponding keys. Dictionaries are very useful when you want to store data in the form of key-value pairs, such as dictionary definitions, test scores, survey results, etc.\n",

    "Control statements are used in programming to alter the flow of execution based on certain conditions or criteria. In Python, commonly used control statements include:\n",
    "\n",
    "`if, elif, else:` These statements are used for conditional execution. They allow the program to execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`for loop:` Used for iterating over a sequence (such as lists, tuples, strings, etc.) or any iterable object. It allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly for each item in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "`while loop:` Used for executing a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. It keeps iterating until the condition becomes false.\n",

    "`Assignment statements:` Assigning values to variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Function calls:` Invoking functions to perform specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Import statements:` Importing modules or packages to use their functionality in the current script or program.\n",

    "`Exception handling statements: `Statements used for handling exceptions (errors) that may occur during the execution of a program, such as try, except, finally, etc.\n",

    "`With statements: `Used for resource management, especially for working with files, to ensure that certain resources are properly closed or released after use.\n",
